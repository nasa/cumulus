# Contributing a task

We're tracking reusable Cumulus tasks [in this list](tasks.md) and, if you've got one you'd like to share with others, you can add it!

Right now we're focused on tasks distributed via npm, but are open to including others. For now the script that pulls all the data for each package only supports npm.

## The tasks.md file is generated in the build process

The tasks list in docs/tasks.md is generated from the list of task package names from the tasks folder.

Do not edit the docs/tasks.md file directly.
