# Ancillary Metadata Export

This feature utilizes the `type` key on a files object in a Cumulus [granule](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus/blob/master/packages/api/models/schemas.js).  It uses the key  to provide a mechanism where granule discovery, processing and other tasks can set and use this value to facilitate metadata export to CMR.

## Tasks setting type

### [Discover Granules](../workflow_tasks/discover_granules)

  Uses the Collection `type` key to set the value for files on discovered granules in it's output.

### [Parse PDR](../workflow_tasks/parse_pdr)

  Uses a task-specific mapping to map PDR 'FILE_TYPE' to a CNM type to set `type` on granules from the PDR.

### CNMToCMALambdaFunction

  Natively supports types that are included in incoming messages to a [CNM Workflow](../data-cookbooks/cnm-workflow).

## Tasks using type

### [Move Granules](../workflow_tasks/move_granules)

  Uses the granule file `type` key to update UMM/ECHO 10 CMR files passed in as candidates to the task. This task adds the external facing URLs to the CMR metadata file based on the `type`.
  See the [file tracking data cookbook](../data-cookbooks/tracking-files#publish-to-cmr) for a detailed mapping.
  If a non-CNM `type` is specified, the task assumes it is a 'data' file.
