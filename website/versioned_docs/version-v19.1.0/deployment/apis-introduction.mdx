### Common Distribution APIs

When deploying from the Cumulus Deployment Template or a configuration based on that repo, the Thin Egress App (TEA) distribution app will be used by default. However, you have the choice to use the Cumulus Distribution API as well.

### Cumulus API Customization Use Cases

Our Cumulus API offers you the flexibility to customize for your DAAC/organization. Below is a list of use cases that may help you with options:

- [Cumulus API w/Launchpad Authentication](https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/CUMULUS/Cumulus+API+with+Launchpad+Authentication)
- [Using Cumulus with Private APIs](https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/CUMULUS/Using+Cumulus+with+Private+APIs)
