### Workflows

<details>
  <summary>What is a Cumulus workflow?</summary>

  Answer: A workflow is a provider-configured set of steps that describe the process to ingest data. Workflows are defined using [AWS Step Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/index.html). For more details, we suggest visiting the [Workflows](workflows) section.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I set up a Cumulus workflow?</summary>

  Answer: You will need to create a provider, have an associated collection (add a new one), and generate a new rule first. Then you can set up a Cumulus workflow by following these steps [here](workflows/developing-a-cumulus-workflow).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Where can I find a list of workflow tasks?</summary>

  Answer: You can access a list of reusable tasks for Cumulus development at [Cumulus Tasks](tasks).

### Integrators & Developers

<details>
  <summary>What is a Cumulus integrator?</summary>

  Answer: Those who are working within Cumulus and AWS for deployments and to manage workflows. They may perform the following functions:

- Configure and deploy Cumulus to the AWS environment
- Configure Cumulus workflows
- Write custom workflow tasks

</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are the steps if I run into an issue during deployment?</summary>

  Answer: If you encounter an issue with your deployment go to the [Troubleshooting Deployment](troubleshooting/troubleshoot_deployment.md) guide.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is Cumulus customizable and flexible?</summary>

  Answer: Yes. Cumulus is a modular architecture that allows you to decide which components that you want/need to deploy. These components are maintained as Terraform modules.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are Terraform modules?</summary>

  Answer: They are modules that are composed to create a Cumulus deployment, which gives integrators the flexibility to choose the components of Cumulus that want/need. To view Cumulus maintained modules or steps on how to create a module go to [Terraform modules](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus/tree/master/tf-modules).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Where do I find Terraform module variables</summary>

  Answer: Go [here](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus/blob/master/tf-modules/cumulus/variables.tf) for a list of Cumulus maintained variables.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What are the common use cases that a Cumulus integrator encounters?</summary>

  Answer: The following are some examples of possible use cases you may see:

- [Creating Cumulus Data Management Types](configuration/data-management-types)
