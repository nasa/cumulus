# Create Rule In Cumulus

Once the above files are in place and the entries created in CMR and Cumulus, we are ready to begin ingesting data. Depending on the type of ingestion (FTP/Kinesis, etc) the values below will change, but for the most part they are all similar. Rules tell Cumulus how to associate providers and collections, and when/how to start processing a workflow.

## Steps
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->
1. Go To Rules Page

* Go to the Cumulus dashboard, click on `Rules` in the navigation.
* Click `Add Rule`.

For more details regarding the field definitions and required information go to [Data Cookbooks](https://nasa.github.io/cumulus/docs/data-cookbooks/setup#rules).

> **Note:** If the state field is left blank, it defaults to `false`.

## Examples
