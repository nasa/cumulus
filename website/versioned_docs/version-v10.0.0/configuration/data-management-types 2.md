## What Are The Cumulus Data Management Types

- `Collections`: Collections are logical sets of data objects of the same data type and version. They provide contextual information used by Cumulus ingest.
- `Granules`: Granules are the smallest aggregation of data that can be independently managed. They are always associated with a collection, which is a grouping of granules.
- `Providers`: Providers generate and distribute input data that Cumulus obtains and sends to workflows.
- `Rules`: Rules tell Cumulus how to associate providers and collections and when/how to start processing a workflow.
- `Workflows`: Workflows are composed of one or more AWS Lambda Functions and ECS Activities to discover, ingest, process, manage, and archive data.
- `Executions`: Executions are records of a workflow.
- `Reconciliation Reports`: Reports are a comparison of data sets to check to see if they are in agreement and to help Cumulus users detect conflicts.

## Interaction

- **Providers** tell Cumulus where to get new data - i.e. S3, HTTPS
- **Collections** tell Cumulus where to store the data files
- **Rules** tell Cumulus when to trigger a workflow execution and tie providers and collections together

## Managing Data Management Types

The following are created via the dashboard or API:

- **Providers**
- **Collections**
- **Rules**
- **Reconciliation reports**

**Granules** are created by workflow executions and then can be managed via the dashboard or API.

 An **execution** record is created for each workflow execution triggered and can be viewed in the dashboard or data can be retrieved via the API.

**Workflows** are created and managed via the Cumulus deployment.

## Configuration Fields

### Schemas

Looking at our API schema [definitions](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus/tree/master/packages/api/models/schemas.js) can provide us with some insight into collections, providers, rules, and their attributes (and whether those are required or not). The schema for different concepts will be reference throughout this document.

> The schemas are _extremely_ useful for understanding which attributes are configurable and which of those are required. Cumulus uses these schemas for validation.

### Providers

- [Provider schema](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus/tree/master/packages/api/models/schemas.js) (`module.exports.provider`)
- [Provider API](https://nasa.github.io/cumulus-api/?language=Python#list-providers)
- [Sample provider configurations](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus/tree/master/example/data/providers)

Please note:

- While *connection* configuration is defined here, things that are more specific to a specific ingest setup (e.g. 'What target directory should we be pulling from' or 'How is duplicate handling configured?') are generally defined in a Rule or Collection, not the Provider.
- There is some provider behavior which is controlled by task-specific configuration and not the provider definition. This configuration has to be set on a **per-workflow** basis. For example, see the [`httpListTimeout` configuration on the `discover-granules` task](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus/blob/master/tasks/discover-granules/schemas/config.json#L84)

#### Provider Configuration

The Provider configuration is defined by a JSON object that takes different configuration keys depending on the provider type.    The following are definitions of typical configuration values relevant for the various providers:

|Key  |Value  |Required  |Description|

|granuleId|`"^MOD09GQ\\.A[\\d]{7}\\.[\\S]{6}\\.006\\.[\\d]{13}$"`|Yes|The regular expression used to validate the granule ID extracted from filenames according to the `granuleIdExtraction`|
|granuleIdExtraction|<code>"(MOD09GQ\\..*)(\\.hdf&#124;\\.cmr&#124;_ndvi\\.jpg)"</code>|Yes|The regular expression used to extract the granule ID from filenames. The first capturing group extracted from the filename by the regex will be used as the granule ID.|

|duplicateHandling|`"replace"`|No|<code>("replace"&#124;"version"&#124;"skip")</code> determines granule duplicate handling scheme|
|ignoreFilesConfigForDiscovery|`false` (default)|No|By default, during discovery only files that match one of the regular expressions in this collection's `files` attribute (see above) are ingested.  Setting this to `true` will ignore the `files` attribute during discovery, meaning that all files for a granule (i.e., all files with filenames matching `granuleIdExtraction`) will be ingested even when they don't match a regular expression in the `files` attribute at _discovery_ time.  (NOTE: this attribute does not appear in the example file, but is listed here for completeness.)

</details>

### Rules

- [Rule schema](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus/tree/master/packages/api/models/schemas.js) (`module.exports.rule`)
- [Rule API](https://nasa.github.io/cumulus-api/?language=Python#list-rules)

- [Sample SQS rule](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus/blob/master/example/spec/parallel/testAPI/data/rules/sqs/MOD09GQ_006_sqsRule.json)

Rules are used by to start processing workflows and the transformation process. Rules can be invoked manually, based on a schedule, or can be configured to be triggered by either events in [Kinesis](data-cookbooks/cnm-workflow.md), SNS messages or SQS messages.

<details>
<summary><b>Rule configuration</b></summary>

|Key  |Value  |Required|Description|
|:---:|:-----:|:------:|-----------|
|name|`"L2_HR_PIXC_kinesisRule"`|Yes|Name of the rule. This is the name under which the rule will be listed on the dashboard|

#### collection-object

|Key  |Value  |Required|Description|
|:---:|:-----:|:------:|-----------|
|name|`"L2_HR_PIXC"`|Yes|Name of a collection defined/configured in the Collections dashboard page|
|version|`"000"`|Yes|Version number of a collection defined/configured in the Collections dashboard page|

#### meta-object

|Key  |Value  |Required|Description|
|:---:|:-----:|:------:|-----------|
|retries|`3`|No|Number of retries on errors, for sqs-type rule only. Defaults to 3.|
|visibilityTimeout|`900`|No|VisibilityTimeout in seconds for the inflight messages, for sqs-type rule only. Defaults to the visibility timeout of the SQS queue when the rule is created.|

#### rule-object

|Key|Value|Required|Description|
|:---:|:-----:|:------:|-----------|
|type|`"kinesis"`|Yes|<code>("onetime"&#124;"scheduled"&#124;"kinesis"&#124;"sns"&#124;"sqs")</code> type of scheduling/workflow kick-off desired|
|value|`<String> Object`|Depends|Discussion of valid values is [below](#rule-value)|

#### rule-value

The `rule - value` entry depends on the type of run:

- If this is a onetime rule this can be left blank. [Example](data-cookbooks/hello-world.md/#execution)
- If this is a scheduled rule this field must hold a valid [cron-type expression or rate expression](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/ScheduledEvents.html).
- If this is a kinesis rule, this must be a configured `${Kinesis_stream_ARN}`. [Example](data-cookbooks/cnm-workflow.md#rule-configuration)
- If this is an sns rule, this must be an existing `${SNS_Topic_Arn}`. [Example](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus/blob/master/example/spec/parallel/testAPI/snsRuleDef.json)
- If this is an sqs rule, this must be an existing `${SQS_QueueUrl}` that your account has permissions to access, and also you must configure a dead-letter queue for this SQS queue. [Example](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus/blob/master/example/spec/parallel/testAPI/data/rules/sqs/MOD09GQ_006_sqsRule.json)

#### sqs-type rule features

- When an SQS rule is triggered, the SQS message remains on the queue.
- The SQS message is not processed multiple times in parallel when visibility timeout is properly set.  You should set the visibility timeout to the maximum expected length of the workflow with padding. Longer is better to avoid parallel processing.
- The SQS message visibility timeout can be overridden by the rule.
- Upon successful workflow execution, the SQS message is removed from the queue.
- Upon failed execution(s), the workflow is run 3 or configured number of times.
- Upon failed execution(s), the visibility timeout will be set to 5s to allow retries.
- After configured number of failed retries, the SQS message is moved to the dead-letter queue configured for the SQS queue.
