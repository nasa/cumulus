## Purpose

Operator Docs are an augmentation to Cumulus documentation and Data Cookbooks. These documents will walk step-by-step through common Cumulus activities (that aren't necessarily as use-case directed as what you'd see in Data Cookbooks).

## What Is A Cumulus Operator

Cumulus operators are those who work within Cumulus to ingest/archive data and manage collections. They may perform the following functions via the operator dashboard or API:

* Configure providers and collections
* Configure rules and monitor workflow executions
* Monitor granule ingestion
* Monitor system metrics
