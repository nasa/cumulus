# Choice States

Cumulus supports AWS Step Function [`Choice`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/amazon-states-language-choice-state.html) states. A `Choice` state enables branching logic in Cumulus workflows.

`Choice` state definitions include a list of `Choice Rule`s. Each `Choice Rule` defines a logical operation which compares an input value against a value using a comparison operator. For available comparision operators, review [the AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/amazon-states-language-choice-state.html).

If the comparison evaluates to `true`, the `Next` state is followed.

## Example

In [examples/workflows/sips.yml](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus/blob/master/example/workflows/sips.yml) the `ParsePdr` workflow uses a `Choice` state, `CheckAgainChoice`, to terminate the workflow once `meta.isPdrFinished: true` is returned by the `CheckStatus` state.

The `CheckAgainChoice` state definition requires an input object of the following structure:

```json
{
  "cumulus_meta": {
    "isPdrFinished": false
  }
}
```

Given the above input to the `CheckAgainChoice` state, the workflow would transition to the `PdrStatusReport` state.

```yaml
    CheckAgainChoice:
      Type: Choice
      Choices:
        - Variable: $.meta.isPdrFinished
          BooleanEquals: false
          Next: PdrStatusReport
        - Variable: $.meta.isPdrFinished
          BooleanEquals: true
          Next: StopStatus
```

## Advanced: Loops in Cumulus Workflows

Understanding the complete `ParsePdr` workflow is not necessary to understanding how `Choice` states work, but `ParsePdr` provides an example of how `Choice` states can be used to create a loop in a Cumulus workflow.

In the complete `ParsePdr` workflow definition, the state `QueueGranules` is followed by `CheckStatus`. From `CheckStatus` a loop starts: Given `CheckStatus` returns `meta.isPdrFinished: false`, `CheckStatus` is followed by `CheckAgainChoice` is followed by `PdrStatusReport` is followed by `WaitForSomeTime`, which returns to `CheckStatus`. Once `CheckStatus` returns `meta.isPdrFinished: true`, `CheckAgainChoice` proceeds to `StopStatus`.
