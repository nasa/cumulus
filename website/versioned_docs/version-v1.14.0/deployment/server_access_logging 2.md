# S3 Server Access Logging

Note: to support [EMS Reporting](../features/ems_reporting), you need to enable [Amazon S3 server access logging][awslogging] on all protected and public buckets.


### Via AWS Console

[Enable server access logging for an S3 bucket][howtologging]

### Via [AWS Command Line Interface][cli]


1. create a `logging.json` file with these contents, replacing `<stack-internal-bucket>` with your stack's internal bucket name, and `<stack>` with the name of your cumulus stack.
	```json
	{
		"LoggingEnabled": {
			"TargetBucket": "<stack-internal-bucket>",
			"TargetPrefix": "<stack>/ems-distribution/s3-server-access-logs/"
		}
	}
	```
2. Add the logging policy to each of your protected and public buckets by calling this command on each bucket.

	```sh
	aws s3api put-bucket-logging --bucket <protected/public-bucket-name> --bucket-logging-status file://logging.json
	```
3. Verify the logging policy exists on your buckets..
	```sh
	aws s3api get-bucket-logging --bucket <protected/public-bucket-name>
	```
