# Running Step Function Tasks in AWS Lambda or Docker

## Overview

[AWS Step Function Tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-tasks.html) can run tasks on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) or on [AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) as a Docker container.

Lambda provides serverless architecture, providing the best option for minimizing cost and server management. ECS provides the fullest extent of AWS EC2 resources via the flexibility to execute arbitrary code on any AWS EC2 instance type.

## When to use Lambda

You should use AWS Lambda whenever all of the following are true:

* The task runs on one of the supported [Lambda Runtimes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html). At time of this writing, supported runtimes include versions of python, Java, Ruby, node.js, Go and .NET.
* The lambda package is less than 50 MB in size, zipped.
* The task consumes less than each of the following resources:
  * 3008 MB memory allocation
  * 512 MB disk storage (must be written to `/tmp`)
  * 15 minutes of execution time

See [this page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html) for a complete and up-to-date list of AWS Lambda limits.

If your task requires more than any of these resources or an unsupported runtime, creating a Docker image which can be run on ECS is the way to go. Cumulus supports running any lambda package (and its configured layers) as a Docker container with [`cumulus-ecs-task`](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus-ecs-task).

## Step Function Activities and `cumulus-ecs-task`

[Step Function Activities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-activities.html) enable a state machine task to "publish" an activity task which can be picked up by any activity worker. Activity workers can run pretty much anywhere, but Cumulus workflows support the [`cumulus-ecs-task`](https://github.com/nasa/cumulus-ecs-task) activity worker. The `cumulus-ecs-task` worker runs as a Docker container on the Cumulus ECS cluster.

The `cumulus-ecs-task` container takes an AWS Lambda Amazon Resource Name (ARN) as an argument (see `--lambdaArn` in the example below). This ARN argument is defined at deployment time. The `cumulus-ecs-task` worker polls for new Step Function Activity Tasks. When a Step Function executes, the worker (container) picks up the activity task and runs the code contained in the lambda package defined on deployment.

## Example: Replacing AWS Lambda with a Docker container run on ECS

Whether using AWS Lambda or Step Functions Activities, there will be a lambda package defined in `lambdas.yml`:

```yaml
QueueGranules:
  handler: index.handler
  timeout: 900
  memory: 3008
  source: node_modules/@cumulus/queue-granules/dist/
  useMessageAdapter: true
```

Given the `QueueGranules` lambda package is already used in a Step Function State Machine definition, the following will exist in a workflow YAML file:

```yaml
    QueueGranules:
      Type: Task
      Resource: ${QueueGranulesLambdaFunction.Arn}
      Next: StopStatus
```

Given it has been discovered this task can no longer run in AWS Lambda, it can be run on the Cumulus ECS cluster by including the following in `app/config.yml`:

```yaml
  ecs:
    instanceType: t2.large
    desiredInstances: 1
    services:
      QueueGranules:
        docker: true
        image: cumuluss/cumulus-ecs-task:1.2.5
        memory: 4000
        count: 1
        envs:
          AWS_DEFAULT_REGION:
            function: Fn::Sub
            value: '${AWS::Region}'
        commands:
          - cumulus-ecs-task
          - '--activityArn'
          - function: Ref
            value: QueueGranulesActivity
          - '--lambdaArn'
          - function: Ref
            value: QueueGranulesLambdaFunction

  activities:
    - name: QueueGranules
```

and then modifying the corresponding Step Function State Machine definition in a workflow YAML file:

```yaml
    QueueGranules:
      Type: Task
      Resource: ${QueueGranulesActivity}
      Next: StopStatus
```

## How do I name my resources? A short primer on Cumulus resource naming conventions

Cumulus deployments currently depend on the [`kes`](https://github.com/developmentseed/kes) cli tool. `kes` references values in `app/config.yml`, `iam/config.yml`, lambda and workflow `.yml` files to populate the cloudformation templates that are a part of the `@cumulus/deployment` package. `kes` generates final cloudformation files and uploads them to AWS Cloudformation, creating or updating AWS Cloudformation Stacks.

When deploying AWS Lambdas and AWS Activities as detailed above, note the following naming conventions:

* `QueueGranules` in `lambdas.yml`: When kes generates the final cloudformation file, it will define a resource called `QueueGranulesLambdaFunction`. A valid lambda function resource name, such as `QueueGranulesLambdaFunction`, must be used in `app/config.yml` when passed as a command argument to `cumulus-ecs-task`.
* `QueueGranules` in `app/config.yml`: The string `QueueGranules` exists twice in the `app/config.yml` above.
  * The first occurrence is as a key under `services`. This key provides a descriptive prefix when naming the corresponding ECS Service. It will be included in final cloudformation YAML as an `AWS::ECS::Service` resource with the name `QueueGranulesECSService`. This ECS Service name prefix (`QueueGranules` in this example) can be anything since the service is not referenced in any other part of the deployment at this time.
  * The second occurrence of `QueueGranules` is as a value under `activities: - name:`. The value of `activites: - name:` can be anything, but the `--activityArn` command argument passed to `cumulus-ecs-task` must use this value plus `Activity` as a suffix (`QueueGranulesActivity` in this example).

## Final Note

Step Function Activities and AWS Lambda are not the only ways to run tasks in an AWS Step Function. Learn more about other service integrations, including direct ECS integration via the [AWS Service Integrations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-connectors.html) page.
