# Creating an S3 Bucket

Buckets can be created on the command line with [AWS CLI][cli] or via the web interface on the [AWS console][web].

When creating a protected bucket (a bucket containing data which will be
served through the distribution API), make sure to enable S3 Server Access
Logging. See [EMS Reporting](ems_reporting.md) for more details.


## Command line

Using the [AWS command line tool][cli] [create-bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/create-bucket.html) s3api subcommand:

```
$ aws s3api create-bucket --bucket foobar-internal
{
    "Location": "/foobar-internal"
}
```

Please note security settings and other bucket options can be set via the options listed in the s3api documentation.

Repeat the above step for each bucket to be created.
