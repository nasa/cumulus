# Upgrading to Cumulus 1.7.0

Cumulus 1.7 stores granules, pdrs and executions data in DynamoDB and uses ElasticSearch to only index and search them.

If you are upgrading to 1.7, it means you have granules, pdrs and executions data that are stored in your ElasticSearch instance but they have to be migrated to DynamoDB.

Cumulus 1.7 creates a lambda function for the migration. The lambda function is named `<your-cloudformation-stack-name>-executeMigrations`

You have to invoke this lambda function at the end of your deployment to copy your records from ElasticSearch to DynamoDB. This is possible in three ways:

1. **Use cumulus-api command line utility:**
```
$ ./node_modules/.bin/cumulus-api migrate --stack <your-cloudformation-stack-name>
```
2. **Invoke the lambda function directly with AWS CLI:**
```
$ aws lambda invoke --function-name <your-cloudformation-stack-name>-executeMigrations
```
3. **Invoke the lambda function from the AWS website:**
  - go to the lambda service
  - find the `<your-cloudformation-stack-name>-executeMigrations`
  - click on `Test` Button
