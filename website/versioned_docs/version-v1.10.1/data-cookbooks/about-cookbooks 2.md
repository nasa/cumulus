# About

### What is a data cookbook?

The following data cookbooks are documents containing examples and explanations of workflows in the Cumulus framework. Additionally, the following data cookbooks should serve to help unify an institution/user group on a set of terms.

### Adding a page

As shown in detail on in the relevant [documentation](https://toolchain.gitbook.com/pages.html), you can add a new page to the data cookbook by creating a markdown (`.md`) file in the `docs/data-cookbooks` directory. The new page can then be linked to the webpage itself by adding it to the `sidebar.json` file in the `website/` directory.
