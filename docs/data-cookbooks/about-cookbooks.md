# About

## Introduction

The following data cookbooks are documents containing examples and explanations of workflows in the Cumulus framework. Additionally, the following data cookbooks should serve to help unify an institution/user group on a set of terms.

## Adding a page

As shown in detail in the "Add a New Page and Sidebars" section in [Cumulus Docs: How To's](docs-how-to.md), you can add a new page to the data cookbook by creating a markdown (`.md`) file in the `docs/data-cookbooks` directory. The new page can then be linked to the sidebar by adding it to the `Data-Cookbooks` object in the `website/sidebar.json` file as `data-cookbooks/${id}`.
